# Learning-JAVA-MIT-OCW

I have been learning coding in Java from MIT OCW. 
These are the solutions for the course: 6.092 Intro to Programming in Java. 
I have learnt to make classes and to inport different packages (like graphics) to make simple drawing and animation with the help of the starting code and instruction provided.
